FrooxEngine.LogiX.Debug.DebugAxes:#########################################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Debug Axes</color> node generates a temporary set of axes with the specified properties when an impulse is received at Display.
Usage

The Position determines the global position where the axis origin will be.


The Rotation determines the global rotation of the axes.


The Length determines the length of the axis arrow visuals.


The RightColor sets the color of the X axis visual.


The UpColor sets the color of the Y axis visual.


The ForwardColor sets the color of the Z axis visual.


The Duration determines the number of seconds that the axes are visible.


The OnDisplay output fires an impulse when the axes are successfully displayed.


Slots for the debug visuals are produced under a non-persistent slot under the root slot named '_DEBUG'. Children are produced under that slot for each individual user for whom a debug node fires.
}

The Orientation input controls the rotation of the box visual.


The Color input determines the color of the box visual.


The Duration input determines the number of seconds that the box visual persists.


The OnDisplay output fires an impulse when the box is successfully displayed.


Slots for the debug visuals are produced under a non-persistent slot under the root slot named '_DEBUG'. Children are produced under that slot for each individual user for whom a debug node fires. 
}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Debug.DebugLine:#########################################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Debug Line</color> node generates a temporary line with the specified properties when an impulse is received at Display.
Usage

The Color determines the color of the line visual.


The Radius determines the radius of the line visual.


The Duration determines the number of seconds that the line visual persist.


The OnDisplay output fires an impulse when the line is successfully displayed.


Slots for the debug visuals are produced under a non-persistent slot under the root slot named '_DEBUG'. Children are produced under that slot for each individual user for whom a debug node fires.

}

FrooxEngine.LogiX.Debug.DebugSphere:######################################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Debug Sphere</color> node generates a temporary sphere visual with the specified properties when an impulse is received at Display.
Usage

The Point input determines the global position of the sphere visual center point.


The Radius input determines the radius of the sphere visual.


The Color input determines the color of the sphere visual.


The Duration input determines the number of seconds that the sphere visual persists.


The OnDisplay output fires an impulse when the sphere is successfully displayed.

Slots for the debug visuals are produced under a non-persistent slot under the root slot named '_DEBUG'. Children are produced under that slot for each individual user for whom a debug node fires. 
}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Debug.DebugText:########################################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Debug Text</color> node generates a temporary text visual with the specified properties when an impulse is received at Display.
Usage

The Position input determines the global position of the text visual center point. This defaults to being centered on the Debug Text node itself.

The Text input determines the content of the text visual. Rich text parsing is enabled.

The Size determines the size of the text visual. A value of 1 is recommended over the default which is very small.

The Color determines the color of the text visual.

The Duration input determines the number of seconds that the text visual persists.

The OnDisplay output fires an impulse when the text is successfully displayed.

Slots for the debug visuals are produced under a non-persistent slot under the root slot named '_DEBUG'. Children are produced under that slot for each individual user for whom a debug node fires. 
}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Debug.DebugTriangle:####################################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Debug Triangle</color> node generates a temporary triangle visual with the specified properties when an impulse is received at Display.
Usage

The Point0, Point1, and Point2 inputs determine the global positions of the triangle vertices.


The Color input determines the color of the triangle visual.


The Duration input determines the number of seconds that the triangle visual persists.


The OnDisplay output fires an impulse when the triangle is successfully displayed.


Slots for the debug visuals are produced under a non-persistent slot under the root slot named '_DEBUG'. Children are produced under that slot for each individual user for whom a debug node fires.

}




FrooxEngine.LogiX.Debug.DebugVector:######################################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Debug Vector</color> node generates an arrow visual with the specified properties when an impulse is received at Display.
Usage

The Position input determines the global position of the arrow origin (tail).


The Vector input determines the global direction vector along which the arrow points. The values are not normalized before generating the visual.


The RadiusRatio input is a scaling factor which affects the radius and arrow head size of the displayed visual.


The Color input determines the color of the box visual.


The Duration input determines the number of seconds that the box visual persists.


The OnDisplay output fires an impulse when the vector arrow is successfully displayed.


Slots for the debug visuals are produced under a non-persistent slot under the root slot named '_DEBUG'. Children are produced under that slot for each individual user for whom a debug node fires.
