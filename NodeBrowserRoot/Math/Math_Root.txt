When spawned, whether from the node browser or through duplication, the node's output is the value of its target. 
}




FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.Quaternions.ConstantSlerp:###################

The <color=#00FF00>Cubic Lerp</color> node outputs the value that is interpolated between From and To with the Lerp input mapped to a spline curve which can be contorted by paired tangent inputs (From Tangent and To Tangent). This results in a much more customizable interpolation than any other current interpolation method in LogiX, with the added work of having to define tangents.
Usage

When spawned from the node browser, this node accepts float data by default. However, this node can be overloaded to accept a wide variety of numeric datatypes if an appropriate wire is connected to the input. The datatype must support decimal places due to the nature of the function. This node does not officially support FloatQ datatype. Attempting to interpolate a FloatQ by first converting it to an Euler angle may yield unexpected results.

Each input point defined has an associated tangent, this tangent is used to define the 'velocity' at that point. This means that if you were interpolating from point A to point B the instantaneous velocity of a point at A (The start of the interpolation) would perfectly match the tangent input associated with A and would end up matching the associated tangent of B once it reaches it.

(is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.[1][2] Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero.[3] However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, since 0 is the only common multiple of a and 0. ) --- Wikipedia

}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.MultiLerp:##################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Multi Lerp</color> node is the same as Lerp_(LogiX_node) but takes an arbitrary number of inputs.
Usage

When spawned from the node browser, this node accepts float data by default. However, this node can be overloaded to accept a wide variety of numeric datatypes if an appropriate wire is connected to the input.

The Lerp range is equal to the number of input points minus one. This means that if you have 5 input points then you will reach the final value once the Lerp input is 4. This is because the node functions by interpolating between the individual inputs 2 at a time, essentially working like a regular Lerp_(LogiX_node) in the process.

Suppose you have 3 inputs now, to interpolate between the first 2 inputs, you would need to supply a Lerp value which is between 0 and 1. Similarly, to interpolate between the second and third input, you will need to supply a Lerp value which is between 1 and 2. 
}

}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.Remap:#######################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Remap</color> node linearly maps one numerical interval to another interval.
Usage
Examples

An input interval of [-1, 1], an output interval of [0, 1], and an input value of -0.5 would result in the output 0.25. This is because -0.5 represents a fourth of the difference between -1 and 1 and is thus remapped to a fourth of the difference between 0 and 1. 
}



FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.Remap11_01:##################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Remap -1..1 to 0..1</color> node linearly maps the numerical interval [-1, 1] to the interval [0, 1]. This is commonly used for remapping trigonometric functions onto an exclusively positive interval. This node behaves similarly to the Remap node but includes the aforementioned intervals by default. 
}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.Repeat:#######################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Repeat</color> node in the Math category takes two arguments, N and Length and outputs the result of the following calculation

    N - floor(N/Length) * Length

so that the output goes between 0 and Length in a repeating fashion, as described in Usage. 

Usage

This node repeats values between 0 and Length, as N is increased. When N is 0, the output is 0, and then the output increases with N, until N reaches the value Length, and it goes to 0, and repeats this pattern for ever. This pattern looks like a positive-valued sawtooth wave as shown below, for a value of Length=2.2 


Note: This node behaves in the same way as Modulus operator (denotes %) in other programming languages, like Python. LogiX uses the different definition of % which C# uses, and therefore offers the Repeat node when the above behaviour is desired.

The Repeat01 (LogiX node) is equivalent to this node, where Length is set to 1. 

}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.Repeat01:#######################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Repeat01</color> node in the Math category takes one argument Value, and does the same operation as the Repeat (LogiX node) where N is set to Value and Length is set to 1, that is it outputs

    Value - floor(Value)

This means that the output goes between 0 and 1 in a repeating fashion, as described in Usage.

Usage

This node repeats values between 0 and 1, as N is increased. When N is 0, the output is 0, and then the output equals N as N increases, until N reaches the value 1, and the output goes to 0, and repeats this pattern for ever. This pattern looks like a positive-valued sawtooth wave as shown below, 
}



FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.Round:##########################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Round</color> node outputs the value N rounded to the nearest integer. Note that this node returns an float instead of an integer. Because floating-point errors can occur when using floats, this node may offer less precision and reliability than would otherwise be attainable with the Round To Int node. 
}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.RoundToInt:#####################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Round To Int</color> node outputs the value N rounded to the nearest integer. Note that this node returns an integer instead of a rounded float. Because floating-point errors can occur when using floats, this node can offer greater precision and reliability than would otherwise be attainable with the Round node. 
}



FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.SigmoidNode:#####################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Sigmoid</color> node returns the output of the Sigmoid function according to E[Clarification needed] and a specified power.

(The sigmoid function forms an S shaped graph, which means as x approaches infinity, the probability becomes 1, and as x approaches negative infinity, the probability becomes 0. The model sets a threshold that decides what range of probability is mapped to which binary variable.) --- educative.io

}


FrooxEngine.LogiX.Math.SmoothLerp:#########################################################
{
The <color=#00FF00>Smooth Lerp</color> node smoothly interpolates from it's current value to a specified target value at a given speed. 

Usage

When spawned, the Smooth Lerp node's default data type is float. This can be overloaded to accept the float2, float3, float4, and Color data types by plugging the desired data types into the Target input.

Using a floatQ data type will automatically change the node into a Smooth Slerp logix node, which cannot normally be accessed inside of the Node Browser.

When spawned, whether from the node browser or through duplication, the node's output is the value of its target.
